# WeeklySchedule
Android app for organizing weekly schedules by categories and displaying them in tables.

* Code:
  - [x] Convert to `Kotlin`. (The awfully written Java version is still on another branch).
  - [x] Rewrite with `MVVM Architecture` using `Room` for **SQLite** & `LiveData`.
  - [x] Apply **Dependency Injection** using `Dagger2`

* App interface & functionality:
  - [x] Add a **multi-choice dialog** for creating multiple events in multiple days at once.
  - [x] Enable **2-week schedules**.
  - [ ] Enable **multi-day long events**.
