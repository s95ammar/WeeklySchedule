# ðŸ›‘ *Branch out of date* ðŸ›‘

The code on this branch was written in March - June.

- Data was being saved as JSON in shared preferences as huge lists of objects.
- Bugs occured when deleting objects, which are dependencies of other objects.
- Architecture pattern was MV (yes, I know it doesn't exist. It's just Models & Views).

The code here is just bad. Seriously, for your own good, don't look at it. The only reason this branch is still here is that it holds good memories of the time I spent writing this awful code :)
